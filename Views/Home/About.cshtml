                <h2>About SE TRENDZZ</h2>
                <p>
                    SE TRENDZZ was created with the vision of bridging the gap between students and teachers by promoting a more engaging and interactive environment within the department. We noticed that most interactions are limited to academics, leaving little room for casual or fun engagement. This platform aims to encourage open communication, build stronger connections, and bring a sense of community through features that go beyond the classroom.
